Pickled eggs with a spicy twist.

- Hard boiling: 25 min
- Pickling: 20 min
- Fermentation: 1-2 weeks

## Ingredients
- 9-10 hard boiled eggs ([recipe here](https://based.cooking/eggs))
- 2 3/4 cups white vinegar
- 3/4 cups water
- 1 tbsp salt
- 5 jalapenos sliced
- 1/4 white onion sliced
- 1-2 garlic cloves
- Ziploc bag (optional)

## Directions
1. Put eggs in jars with jalapenos, onions, and garlic cloves between eggs.
2. Pour water and vinegar into saucepan, add salt, heat, and mix until dissolved.
3. Pour brine into jar, leaving 1/4" headspace (using a [jar funnel](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=jar+funnel&_sacat=0) helps). Submerge all ingredients completely with brine, as unsoaked food will rot. This can be ensured by cramming a partially inflated ziploc bag underneath the lid, raising the water level.
4. Screw the lid loosely to allow fermentation gasses to escape.
5. Let cool and ferment in refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. Alternatively, you could can them in a pressure cooker and let them ferment without refrigeration.
